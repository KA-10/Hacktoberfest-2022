ABOUT
HACKTOBERFEST LORE
HACKTOBERFEST IS DIGITALOCEAN’S ANNUAL EVENT THAT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE THROUGHOUT OCTOBER. MUCH OF MODERN TECH INFRASTRUCTURE—INCLUDING SOME OF DIGITALOCEAN’S OWN PRODUCTS—RELIES ON OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS BUILT AND MAINTAINED BY PASSIONATE PEOPLE WHO OFTEN DON’T HAVE THE STAFF OR BUDGETS TO DO MUCH MORE THAN KEEP THE PROJECT ALIVE. HACKTOBERFEST IS ALL ABOUT GIVING BACK TO THOSE PROJECTS, SHARPENING SKILLS, AND CELEBRATING ALL THINGS OPEN SOURCE, ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE OPEN SOURCE SO SPECIAL.

FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE—CODERS AND NON-CODERS ALIKE—HAVE PARTICIPATED IN HACKTOBERFEST TO SUPPORT THE PROJECTS THEY USE AND LOVE, LEARN AND PRACTICE SKILLS THAT WILL ENHANCE THEIR CAREERS, AND MEET NEW PEOPLE WHO LOVE OPEN SOURCE AS MUCH AS THEY DO.


NEW FOR 2022
LOW OR NON CODE CONTRIBUTIONS
CONTRIBUTING TO OPEN SOURCE ISN’T JUST FOR TECHNICAL FOLKS WHO WANT TO WRITE CODE. THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO USE YOUR PROFESSIONAL SKILLS IN SUPPORT OF OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS. THIS YEAR, WE’RE MAKING A POINT TO ENCOURAGE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT REQUIRE SOME TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE OR NONE AT ALL. NO MATTER YOUR EXPERIENCE, YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN HACKTOBERFEST!

HACKTOBERFEST WELCOMES PEOPLE OF ANY EXPERIENCE LEVEL TO PARTICIPATE, AND LOW-CODE AND NON-CODE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FANTASTIC CHOICES FOR FOLKS WHO DON’T HAVE A LOT OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE. HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF WAYS YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS:

LOW-CODE	NON-CODE
WRITING	
TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
TRANSLATING
COPY EDITING
DESIGN	
TESTING
USER EXPERIENCE TESTING
GRAPHIC DESIGN
VIDEO PRODUCTION
ADVOCACY**	
TALKS OR PRESENTATIONS
TECHNICAL BLOG POSTS
PODCASTS

CONTRIBUTORS SUBMITTING LOW- OR NON-CODE CONTENT TO PROJECTS SHOULD CREATE A PR/MR TO TRACK IT. WHILE HACKTOBERFEST TRACKS ALL PR/MRS SUBMITTED FOR THE EVENT, MAINTAINERS MAY NEED TO FACILITATE TRACKING OF THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH AN ACTIVITY LOG OR SIMILAR.
